## `About`

BlackJack game
he

## `About the API`

I've used the [DeckofcardsAPI](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) 

## `Working process` :wrench:

I started out choosing the API not really sure if i could be capable of creating a blackjack game with it. And as you can see the game does not work completely but i am still working on it and eventually i hope it can work correctly

### `To dos` :clipboard:
- make "ACE" 11 or 1 depending on when
- make counting of cards when more cards work.
- make better CSS 
- make the game work correctly
